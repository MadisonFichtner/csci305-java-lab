1)	My LastPlayBot works by updating the opposing players last played hand in the
	LastPlayBot's Player class. It updates each round, so that the LastPlayBot has a record
	of what their opponent played on the previous turn each round.
	
2)	MyBot uses the strategy of 1st) randomly selecting a hand to play, 2) continuing 
	to use the same hand until they lose, and final if they lose 3) MyBot randomly
	selects a new hand to play and repeats the process until they lose again. The 
	way I accomplished this was similar to the LastPlayBots implementation. I updated
	MyBots last played element each round and whether they won or lost, and then based
	my logic off of that information stored in the Player class.
